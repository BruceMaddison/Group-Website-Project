    <p>The background piano image came from: <a href="http://www.stockvault.net/photo/96355/piano-keys">http://www.stockvault.net/photo/96355/piano-keys</a></p>
    <p>The icon used for the webpages came from: <a href="http://www.fancyicons.com/free-icon/135/musical-instruments-icon-set/free-trumpet-icon-png/">http://www.fancyicons.com/free-icon/135/musical-instruments-icon-set/free-trumpet-icon-png/</a></p>
    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Split the work up, making it easier to focus on our own parts. Larger range of ideas for the design of the website. Some peoples strengths cover other peoples weaknesses. </p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Having to rely on others. Collaborating work together. If one person messes something up it can affect everyones work. Work was hard to split evenly between the group members. Meeting times that worked with every member of the group. </p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> The Townsville Music Centre website redesign. Getting to see things from other peoples perspective. The experience of working with a group of people. </p>

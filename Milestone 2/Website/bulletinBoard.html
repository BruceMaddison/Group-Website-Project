                    <p>Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs on the Strand. </p>
                    <p>I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform. </p>
                    <p>Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music. </p>
                    <p>I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites. </p>
                    <p>Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7. </p>
                    <p>If you would like to take part, please call Merle Trembath 0418882633 anytime </p>
